# CodeAlpha_Iris_Flower_Classification
Iris Flower Classification Data Science Project

**Overview**
  ->This notebook is part of my CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.

**Objective:**  
  ->Build a simple machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on their features.

**Dataset:**  
  -> The classic Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features)
  -> Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
  -> Target: Species

What This Notebook Includes
  -> Data loading and inspection  
  -> Data visualization  
  -> Splitting data & training ML model  
  -> Model accuracy check

**How to Run**
  ->Open `.ipynb` in Google Colab → Run all cells → View results.

**Libraries Used**
  -> pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
